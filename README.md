# ChipCompiler
A mindustry mod that allows you to compile strings to instructions.

This mod contains:

- Full on text -> Logic instruction system
- Chip Reader Schematic (get from the GUI)
- Mobile & PC support (No keybinds... yet)

The mod is very useful for scattering chips along the ground. The chips have a pretty basic encryption, and you can decrypt them with the Chip Reader, which is included in the mod GUI for you to copy and paste into the Schematic Import.

Simply place a processor and input the compiled version of your string in, add a Memory Bank, and link the processor to the Memory bank. You only need a micro processor to fill the memory bank with your data.
